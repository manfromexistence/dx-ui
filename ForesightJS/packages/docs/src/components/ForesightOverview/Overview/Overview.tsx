        <h2>What is ForesightJs?</h2>
        <p>
          ForesightJS is a free and open-source fully typesafe JavaScript library that helps predict
          what users are likely to do next by analyzing their mouse movements and keyboard
          navigation. It lets developers prefetch data ahead of time based on these predictions,
          instead of waiting for actions like clicks or hovers. This makes websites feel faster and
          more responsive for both mouse and keyboard users, and is less wasteful than prefetching
          content as soon as it enters the viewport.
