# Project Architecture Blueprint

Welcome to the project! This document serves as the master blueprint, outlining the purpose of every directory within the project. Understanding this structure is key to contributing effectively and maintaining the high standards of our codebase.

***

## Core Foundation
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/app`** | The heart of the application. Manages all routing, layouts, UI states (loading, error), and page rendering via the App Router. |
| **`/public`** | Stores all static assets (images, fonts, robots.txt) that are served directly without processing. The public-facing file system. |
| **`/styles`** | Contains global stylesheets, CSS variables, and the Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`). The foundation of your visual layer. |
| **`/locales`** | Holds translation files (e.g., `en.json`, `bn.json`) for internationalization (i18n), making the application globally accessible. |
| **`/middleware.ts`** | A single file at the root to intercept incoming requests for authentication, redirects, A/B testing, or setting headers. |

***

## Application Logic
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/components`** | The primary home for all React components, subdivided into `/ui`, `/layouts`, and `/icons` for maximum organization. |
| **`/features`** | Organizes code by domain (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`). Each feature folder is a self-contained module with its own components, hooks, and logic. |
| **`/lib`** | A critical folder for shared utility functions, helper scripts, and client-side SDK initializations (e.g., `utils.ts`, `axios.ts`). |
| **`/hooks`** | Centralizes all custom React hooks (`useSWR`, `useDebounce`) to share stateful and side-effect logic across the application. |
| **`/store`** | The dedicated home for your `dx-store` global state management logic (Zustand, Redux Toolkit). Manages the application's global state. |
| **`/providers`** | Contains all React Context providers, like your `dx-theme` provider, session providers, and query client providers. |
| **`/services`** | Abstracts all communication with external APIs (Stripe, Firebase, etc.). Keeps business logic clean and separate from data fetching implementation. |
| **`/server`** | For complex, server-only logic (e.g., tRPC routers, WebSocket handlers) that should never be exposed to the client bundle. |
| **`/config`** | Holds application-level configuration objects, such as site metadata (`site.ts`), navigation links, or feature flags. |
| **`/constants`** | Stores unchanging, primitive values like API keys, route paths, or magic numbers, keeping them organized and easy to update. |

***

## Data & Content
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/data`** | Centralizes the data access layer. Contains repository patterns or functions that fetch data from your database or APIs. |
| **`/db`** | For all database-specific files: schema definitions (`schema.prisma`), migration files, and raw SQL queries. |
| **`/content`** | The source for content-driven pages, holding Markdown or MDX files for blogs, documentation, or marketing pages. |
| **`/emails`** | Contains your email templates, especially if built as React components using a library like React Email. |
| **`/schemas`** | Dedicated to data validation schemas (using Zod or Yup) for API inputs, form submissions, and environment variables. |
| **`/types`** | A single source of truth for all global TypeScript interfaces and type definitions, ensuring type safety across the entire project. |

***

## Development & Tooling
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/.storybook`** | Configuration and stories for Storybook, allowing you to develop and test UI components in a completely isolated environment. |
| **`/scripts`** | Houses standalone Node.js scripts for automating development tasks like database seeding, data migration, or code generation. |
| **`/generated`** | A dedicated output directory for code automatically generated by tools like Prisma Client or GraphQL Code Generator. |
| **`/mocks`** | Contains mock data and API handlers (e.g., via Mock Service Worker) for use in development and testing without hitting a live backend. |
| **`/patches`** | For storing fixes to third-party packages in `node_modules` using `patch-package`, ensuring stability and control over dependencies. |
| **`/vendor`** | For third-party libraries or code snippets that are not managed via a package manager, used for special integrations or legacy code. |

***

## Testing & QA
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/tests`** | A central directory for all unit and integration tests, often mirroring the project's folder structure for clarity. |
| **`/e2e`** | Contains all end-to-end tests (using Playwright or Cypress) that simulate real user journeys across the entire application. |
| **`/benchmarks`** | Holds performance testing scripts to measure and track the speed of critical functions, components, or API endpoints over time. |
| **`/reports`** | Stores generated reports from tooling, such as code coverage, bundle analysis, or Lighthouse performance audits. |

***

## DevOps & Infra
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/.github`** | Contains all repository-level configurations for GitHub, including CI/CD workflows (`/workflows`), issue templates, and pull request templates. |
| **`/docker`** | Holds all Docker-related files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) for containerizing the application for consistent deployment. |
| **`/workers`** | For Web Worker scripts that run intensive computations off the main thread, preventing the UI from freezing. |
| **`/jobs`** | Defines scheduled or recurring background tasks (cron jobs) for things like report generation, data cleanup, or nightly backups. |
| **`/analytics`** | A dedicated home for analytics code, including event tracking wrappers and initialization scripts for services like Google Analytics. |
| **`/bin`** | For executable scripts that are part of the application's command-line interface or build process. |
| **`/infra`** | For Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation to manage cloud resources. |

***

## Security & Compliance
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/security`** | For security policies, vulnerability scan reports, and configurations for security-related tooling. |
| **`/compliance`** | Stores documentation, audit logs, and configurations required for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2). |
| **`/observability`** | Configures and centralizes logging, metrics, and tracing to provide deep insights into the application's health and performance. |

***

## Project & Governance
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/docs`** | For project documentation, architectural decision records (ADRs), and onboarding guides for new developers. |
| **`/design`** | Stores design system assets, style guides, or Figma file links that are relevant to the development team. |
| **`/legal`** | Contains the source files (e.g., Markdown) for legal documents like Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and license information. |

***

## DX Monorepo
| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/packages`** | The core of your monorepo. Each sub-folder is a separate package in your `dx` ecosystem (e.g., `/style`, `/interaction`, `/ui`, `/viz`). |
