description: What to do if you run into issues with Kibo UI.

## Why are my components not showing the correct styles?

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

## I ran npx kibo-ui add but nothing was added to my project

Double-check that:

- Your current working directory is the root of your project (where package.json lives).
- Your components.json file (if using shadcn-style config) is set up correctly.
- You’re using the latest version of the Kibo CLI:

```bash
npx kibo-ui@latest
```

If all else fails, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/kibo/issues).

## Theme switching doesn’t work — my app stays in light mode

Ensure your app is using the same data-theme system that shadcn/ui and Kibo UI expect. The default implementation toggles a data-theme attribute on the `<html>` element. Make sure your tailwind.config.js is using class or data- selectors accordingly:

## The component imports fail with “module not found”

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has a proper paths alias for `@/` i.e.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## My AI assistant can't access Kibo UI components

1. Verify your config file syntax is valid JSON
2. Check that the file path is correct for your AI tool
3. Restart your AI application after making changes
4. Ensure you have an internet connection for the remote server

## The MCP `npx` command fails

1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed
2. Try running `npm install -g npm` to update npm
3. Check your system's PATH includes npm binaries

## Slow or failing requests to the MCP server

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again - the server might be temporarily busy
3. Let us know if issues persist

## Still stuck?
