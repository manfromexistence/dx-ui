description: Kibo UI supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-driven development.
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems. Think of it as a "universal remote" that lets your AI tools access real-world data and functionality.

Kibo UI supports MCP to supercharge your AI development workflow.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

First, make sure you're using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (Free - recommended for beginners)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (AI-powered code editor)
- [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com/) (AI development platform)
- Other MCP-compatible tools

### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

Depending on your AI tool, you'll need to edit one of these files:

- **Claude Desktop**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **Other tools**: Check your tool's MCP documentation

### Step 3: Add Kibo UI Configuration

Copy and paste this configuration into your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibo-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://www.kibo-ui.com/api/mcp/http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

Close and reopen your AI application for the changes to take effect.

### Step 5: Verify the Connection

Test the integration by asking your AI assistant:

> "What Kibo UI components are available for building a dashboard?"

If successful, your AI should be able to list and explain Kibo UI components!

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can use Kibo UI alongside other MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kibo-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://www.kibo-ui.com/api/mcp/http"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Getting Component Information

Ask your AI assistant:

> Show me how to use the Kibo UI Button component with different variants

Expected response will include current documentation and code examples.

### Building Layouts

> Help me create a dashboard layout using Kibo UI components

Your AI can suggest appropriate layout components and provide implementation code.

### Styling Guidance  

> What are the recommended spacing tokens in Kibo UI?

Get up-to-date information about design tokens and styling conventions.

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling

- The Kibo UI MCP server only provides public component documentation
- No personal data or code is transmitted to our servers
- All communication happens through your chosen AI tool's security layer

### Authentication

- No authentication required for public component information
- Future premium features may require API keys
- Always use official Kibo UI MCP endpoints
