First off, thank you for considering contributing to Kibo UI!

Kibo UI thrives on community involvement, and we welcome contributions of all kinds – from bug fixes and documentation improvements to entirely new components. This guide will help you get started with contributing, including setting up a development environment, our preferred workflow for making changes, and tips for submitting your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute to Kibo UI. Feel free to pick the one that best suits your skills and interests.

## Bug Reports & Fixes

If you find a bug, you can open an issue describing it. Even better, if you track down the cause, feel free to submit a pull request with a fix. When fixing a bug, include a clear description of the problem and the solution in your PR.

## Documentation

Improvements to documentation are very valuable. This could mean fixing typos, clarifying examples, or adding new explanations. If something was unclear to you while using Kibo UI, updating the docs to help future users is a great contribution.

## New Components

Perhaps you built a component that would be useful to others. You can contribute new components to the library. (See [Adding New Components](#adding-new-components) below.)

## Enhancements

You might have ideas to enhance existing components (e.g., add a new prop for a feature, improve accessibility, refactor for performance). We welcome these ideas—just make sure to discuss major changes with maintainers (via an issue or discussion) before investing a lot of time, to ensure it aligns with the project goals.
