description: The benefits of using Kibo UI.
---

Whether you’re prototyping an MVP for a new idea or maintaining a large enterprise application, Kibo UI can adapt to your workflow. Smaller projects benefit from the speed of having pre-built functionality (you get to market faster), while larger projects benefit from the flexibility and open-source nature (you have full control over the code). Because you only include what you use, your bundle size stays small – a critical factor for performance-conscious applications.

## Fully Composable

Every component is designed to be used as a building block. You can compose components together, nest them, or even extend them, giving you complete control over the UI structure. This composability ensures you’re not constrained by rigid pre-made layouts.

## More Than Just Styled Clones

Kibo UI components tend to come with baked-in functionality and logic. For example, complex components like AI Chat inputs, Kanban boards, or Gantt charts include the necessary behavior out of the box. You get intuitive APIs for these advanced components, so you can use them immediately without reinventing their logic.

## Intuitive & Developer-Friendly

The APIs are designed for ergonomics. Props and component names are predictable and well-documented. Because Kibo UI uses TypeScript, you get autocompletion and type safety as you work with the components. The library emphasizes clarity – following patterns familiar from React and Tailwind. This means a minimal learning curve and faster development.

## Accessible & Themeable

Accessibility is a first-class concern. All components aim to follow best practices for ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader compatibility. If a component provides interactive behavior, it’s implemented in line with accessibility standards (often leveraging Radix UI under the hood). Additionally, dark mode and theming are supported by default. Kibo UI uses the same CSS variables approach as shadcn/ui, so components automatically adapt to light or dark themes without extra work. This lets you maintain a consistent look-and-feel and meet user preferences with ease.

## Fast, Flexible Installation

You can pick and choose just the components you need. Kibo UI offers a CLI tool (and also works with the shadcn CLI) for quick installation of any component into your codebase. This means you don’t have to install a huge library upfront – each piece is added on demand, keeping your project lean. The installation process is just a single command (no manual file setup), and you can easily customize the code since it’s added directly to your project (more on this in the [Setup guide](/docs/setup)).
