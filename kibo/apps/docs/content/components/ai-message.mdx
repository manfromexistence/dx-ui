<Preview path="ai-message" />

## Installation

<Installer packageName="ai" />

## Features

- Displays messages from both the user and AI assistant with distinct styling.
- Includes avatar images for message senders with fallback initials.
- Shows the sender's name through avatar fallbacks.
- Automatically aligns user and assistant messages on opposite sides.
- Uses different background colors for user and assistant messages.
- Accepts any React node as message content.

## Notes

Always render the `AIMessageContent` first, then the `AIMessageAvatar`. The `AIMessage` component is a wrapper that determines the alignment of the message.

## Examples

### Render Markdown

We can use the [`AIResponse`](/components/ai-response) component to render markdown content.
