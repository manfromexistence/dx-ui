- Renders as SVG for crisp display at any size
- Fully responsive with automatic sizing

## Examples

### Styling

The QR code is wrapped in a `div` so you can pass in a custom class name to style it.

### Robustness

You can change the robustness of the QR code by passing the `robustness` prop. Higher levels offer a better error resistance but reduce the symbol's capacity.

### Server Component

You can also use the `QRCode` component as a React Server Component, however you'll need to pass in the `foreground` and `background` prop manually as hex values.
